### Discount_calculator

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount, but only if the discount is 20% or higher.

### How It Works
The program asks you to enter the original price of an item. Then it asks for the discount percentage that applies to your cost.
If the discount is 20% or more, it applies the discount. If the discount is less than 20%, it keeps the original price
Finally, it shows you the final price to pay.

### Example
Let's say you found a shirt that costs $50, and it's on sale for 25% off:
Original price: $50
Discount: 25%
Since 25% is more than 20%, the discount is applied.
Final price: $37.50

But if the discount was only 15%:
Original price: $50
Discount: 15%
Since 15% is less than 20%, no discount is applied
Final price: $50

### How to Use
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Save the program as discount_calculator.py
3. Open your command prompt or terminal
4. Navigate to the folder where you saved the file
5. Type python discount_calculator.py and press Enter

Follow the prompts to enter the price and discount percentage

### Code Explanation
The program uses a simple function called calculate_discount that takes two inputs:
The original price of the item
The discount percentage

The function checks if the discount is 20% or higher. If it is, it calculates the discounted price. If not, it returns the original price.
The program then asks for your input, calculates the result, and shows you the final price. It's a handy tool to quickly check if a sale is really giving you a good discount!
